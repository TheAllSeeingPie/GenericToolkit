# GenericToolkit

An exercise in code generation and meta-programming. This solution will hopefully evolve into a way of quickly and easily creating a CRUD API based on Interfaces only.

The idea of using only Interfaces is to help stick to SOLID principles. The idea being that the majority of your API is based on Interfaces for your Entities but where needed concrete classes can be substituted in.
